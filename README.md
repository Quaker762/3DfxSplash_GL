# 3DfxSplash_GL
Original 3Dfx splash screen recreated in OpenGL.

The original 3Dfx logo from the pre-STB merger is possibly (in my opinion) one of the nicest logos in existence.
This is my attempt at giving it a breath of fresh air by using the original data from the glide2x driver that
can be found on GitHub. It's also a fun way of paying respect to one of the most revolutionary tech companies
ever.

This is a fun work in progress. Here's a screenshot of what I have so far!
